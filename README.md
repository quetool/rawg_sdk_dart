# rawg_sdk_dart

This is a very simply RAWG Dart SDK (currently under development). 

It contains methods for interacting with [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs)

## Getting Started

### Installation
For now you can add to your pubspec dependencies the following repository like this

```
  rawg_sdk_dart:
    git: https://github.com/quetool/rawg_sdk_dart
```

_I will be adding this package to pub.dev directory soon_ ðŸ¤ž

### How to use
You need to create a RawgApiClient() instance, which is a singleton and then call it functions. You can add an ApiKey if you want, you can check how to get an ApiKey here [https://rawg.io/apidocs](https://rawg.io/apidocs)

```
var rawg = RawgApiClient();
```

### A few examples:
Get Games:

```
rawg.getGames(completion: (error, nextUrl, games) {
	//
});
```

*error* is a String with an error if required

*nextUrl* is a String with the next url to paginate results if required

*games* is a list of games

This is the definition of getGames():

```
void getGames({String page = '1', 
			 String pageSize = '20', 
			 Map<String, String> moreParams, 
			 dynamic Function(String, String, List<Game>) completion})
```
So, as you can see, it has optionals parameters already setted like page and pageSize and another Map<String, String> moreParams parameter which you can use to add more parameters to the API. You can see which ones here [https://api.rawg.io/docs/#tag/games](https://api.rawg.io/docs/#tag/games)

For example, if you want to search for cyberpunk game in the catalog you can use moreParams like this:

```
rawg.getGames(moreParams: {'search': 'cyberpunk'}, completion: (error, nextUrl, games) {
	//
});
```
You can also ordering results by adding the parameter to the request

```
moreParams: {'ordering': '${OrderingOptions.RATING.value}'},
```
Or in reverse order (add - (minus) to the order string)

```
moreParams: {'ordering': '-${OrderingOptions.RATING.value}'},
```

I facilitated an enum you can use to ordering purposes

```
enum OrderingOptions {
  NAME,
  RELEASED,
  ADDED,
  CREATED,
  RATING,
}

extension OrderingOptionsExtension on OrderingOptions {
  String get value {
    switch (this) {
      case OrderingOptions.NAME:
        return "name";
      case OrderingOptions.RELEASED:
        return "released";
      case OrderingOptions.ADDED:
        return "added";
      case OrderingOptions.CREATED:
        return "created";
      case OrderingOptions.RATING:
        return "rating";
      default:
        return null;
    }
  }
}
```

### More examples:

Get Game Details:

```
rawg.getGameDetails('$gameId', (error, gameDetails) {
	print(error ?? 'NO ERROR');
	print(gameDetails ?? 'NO DATA');
});
```

Get Top Ten Games of all times:

```
rawg.getTopTenGamesAllTime(completion: (error, games) {
	print(error ?? 'NO ERROR');
	print(games ?? 'NO DATA');
});
```

This package has also a function to request the API in any way you want by forming the URL the way you need. So if you want to, you can use just this only function in your app but you will need to cast or parse the resultant `object` because it will be dynamic.

```
rawg.requestCustomUrl('$customUrl', (error, nextUrl, object) {
	print(error ?? 'NO ERROR');
	print(nextUrl ?? 'NO NEXT');
	print(object ?? 'NO DATA');
});
```

`$customUrl` could be something like this: `https://api.rawg.io/api/games?dates=2019-01-01,2019-12-31&ordering=-added`

So, if you know that `object` it will be a `List<Game>` you will need to map it like this:

```
var customUrl = 'https://api.rawg.io/api/games?dates=2019-01-01,2019-12-31&ordering=-added';
rawg.requestCustomUrl('$customUrl', (error, nextUrl, object) {
	if (error == null) {
		var gamesList = object
            .map((dynamic e) => Game.fromJson(e as Map<String, dynamic>))
            .toList();
	}
});
```

`Game` it is the main object of this package. You can find it definition on `lib/core/` folder

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.
